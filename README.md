# YT to MP3

## Introduction

This program is able to convert songs from YouTube to MP3 with the help of the YouTube_dl library.It is also possible to download multiple songs at once. They can be put into a config.json and then the program will detect the file and start downloading the songs.

To download more than one song at a time, you can collect the list of links, inside of the config.json file. To seperate the songs please use a comma after each of the links, which
are wrapped in speech marks.

```json
{ "songs": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHvGQYTAG0"] }
```
